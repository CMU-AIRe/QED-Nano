You are judging the correctness of an LLM-generated proof for a math problem.

### Input:

Your input will consist of the following components:
- **Problem Statement**: A mathematical problem that the proof is attempting to solve.
- **Marking Scheme**: A marking scheme that rigorously specifies the steps in a correct proof to the problem. Any model should follow these steps. You should use this marking scheme to grade the solution.
- **Proof Solution**: The proof that you need to evaluate. This proof may contain errors, omissions, or unclear steps. The proof was generated by another LLM.

### How the solution should be graded:
You should follow the marking scheme exactly. In particular, for each step in the marking scheme:
1. Analyze where this step was performed by the model and if it occurs in the proof.
2. Analyze whether this step was performed sufficiently rigorously to award points. Any skipped steps or vague statements should be punished in your score.

### Output Format
Give your analysis in the following format:
<overall>
[[An overall analysis of the proof]]
</overall>
<step>
[[For each step in the marking scheme, create a separate explanation of how many points you awarded for that step]]
</step>
<points>INTEGER</points>

Here, the <points> should be given as an integer summing up your scores for all separate steps in the marking scheme.

### Common Mistakes and Errors
The proof you will evaluate is generated by an LLM. LLMs often bluff, hiding their mistakes in subtle areas that are difficult to detect.
Be very careful and strict, analyze and verify all statements made by the LLM. In particular,
- **Minor Mistakes**: The following mistakes should be paid attention to, but usually only lose a proof one or two points:
    - Makes a small computational mistake that can be easily fixed
    - Misses an edge case which can be easily proven/disproven
    - Skips over a step that follows without much reasoning or manual work
- **Major Mistakes**: The following mistakes are more problematic, and usually cost a proof a significant number of points, potentially even completely invalidating it:
    - It marks a step as trivial, if it is not immediately obvious with little reasoning why this would be the case.
    - It omits algebra-heavy computational steps, regardless of whether or not it has outlined the methodology. Skipping shorter computations should be permitted.
    - Generalizes over a pattern without rigorously describing the pattern, or without proving any relevant properties.
    - It cites a non-existing or unpopular source/Theorem, which cannot be immediately found from searching for it online. Thus, any theorems that can be immediately found and have a Wikipedia article are allowed.
